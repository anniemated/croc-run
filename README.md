# Dino Game Internship Project

This is a mock internship for secondary school students to learn about the software development process. The project is inspired by the popular Chrome Dino Game. 

Students will take over a previous intern's work and continue to develop the game. They will learn about the software development process, including documentation and code maintainability, while also learning a new library, Pygame - Community Edition.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone:** Clone this repository and open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. **Create Virtual Environment:** In your terminal within your folder, create a virtual environment by running the below command. Use `python3` *if* you are on a Mac/Linux on any of the commands here instead of just `python`.
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
3. **Activate Virtual Environment:** Activate your virtual environment in your IDE/shell.
4. **Install Dependencies:** In your environment, install the required packages by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. **Play:** Run the game by running:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Add Your Features

Now that you have the base game from the previous intern, read through the code and understand how the game works. You can go to [Pygame-CE Docs](https://pyga.me/docs/index.html) to learn more about the library. 

Once you are familiar, begin adding your features to the game. Make sure to document well for any future interns who will take over your work! Commit and push your changes regularly to keep track of your progress.

Some features for you to consider adding:

- Creating a score counter
- Creating a transition screen by transforming surfaces
- Vary enemy spawn logic
- Animate the players
- Change the player,enemies, and environmental assets
- Add double jump
- Features related to increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Add power-ups (for example score doubler, god mode, gain life)
- Add leaderboards, keep track of it in another txt file and display the top 10
- Use a life counter with a game over screen
- Add a pause menu
- Add a settings menu
- Add sound effects and background music
